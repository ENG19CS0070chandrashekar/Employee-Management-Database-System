Abstract:

My purpose of the project was to design and develop a Employee Management Database System in C language. I have used Singly Linked Lists as the primary data structure for storing the employee data. A node in the linked list contains all the data such as Record Number, Employee ID, Employee name, and Salary of the employee. I have also included various other functions apart from the basic such as Add new record, List all record, Modify record, Delete record, and Find num function. I got a better understanding of the Linked List concept as well as created an efficient database management system in C. This project helped me to understand coding as well as theoretical concepts more clearly.


	Introduction:
  Employees management database system has multiple applications in companies and businesses for managing a large number of employee data. It is an efficient way of storing and accessing that particular data. Due to the use of Linked Lists, there isn’t a predefined limit on how much data can be stored making it more widespread. All the user defined functions i have coded work seamlessly and provide a practical view of how a database management system –––should act as.I have used Switch case as a way of letting the user choose one of the four functions provided.


	Problem Statement:
To create an efficient and simple Database management system to manage Employee data, Modify or Delete it, Display all the employee’s data present in the database. The code should also enable the user to modify the existing data as well.  

	Objective:
Creating an efficient database management system using Singly Linked Lists.
It allows User to Add, Delete, Modify, Display Employee’s data from the database.


	Methodology:
I have used Singly Linked List as the primary data structure for our Database system. Singly Linked List are efficient at storing information and their memory isn’t specified beforehand unlike arrays. This makes them suitable for a Database application.

A single node in our Linked List stores the entire data of a single employee. This data includes Record Number, Employee ID, Employee name, and Salary of the employee. A switch case is used to allow user to choose between the four functions provided in our Database.

Pseudo Code:

1.	Display functions provided with numbering.

2.	Allow user to input their choice of function.

3.	Switch case is used to carry out the particular function.

4.	Add Record function adds employee data to the database.

5.	Delete function deletes the employee data from the database.

6.	Display function displays data of all the employees in the database.

7.	Modify function can change the employee’s data.

	Software and hardware Requirement:
	
C Programming Language used.
Code is run in Codeblocks IDE.
GNU GCC is the compiler used.

	Conclusion:
I have successfully designed and developed a C Project that can be used as an Employee Database Management System using Singly Linked List data structure. It provides all the necessary functions that should be included with a database management system.
